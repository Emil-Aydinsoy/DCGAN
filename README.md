# Purpose of the project :
1) implementing DCGAN
2) using tensorboard for displaying results
3) comparing quality of images with normal GAN

# Data Used: MNIST

# Project result:
As we conduct Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks we should learn about ConvTranspose2d
The result of this model was more accurate than that of Normal GAN

# Library used: Pythorch
